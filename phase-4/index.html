                    <p>David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever pair of IT Diploma
                        students who handed in a joint research assignment, complete with the required signed
                        statement that it was all their original work.<br>
                        </p>
                    <p>Tune recalls:</p>
                    <p class="story">"Upon reading the work for grading, I was incredibly impressed to find
                        three pages of the document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
                        that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked 'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'"</p>

                    <p>Anyone attending an IT lecture should expect that the lecturer knows the subject.
                        But IT lecturers are a funny lot.</p>
                    <p>Jun Li, a programmer, recalls working in IT support at a school.</p>
                    <p class="story">"I was told to set up a projector in one of the meeting rooms for school staff,
                        as there was a presentation. Having done that, I hooked the presentation laptop
                        to the network and tried to help one of the speakers from the IT faculty update
                        the laptop to IE7. I logged off and asked her to log on with her account to try
                        IE7.</p>

                    <p class="story">'What is that?' she asked when the IE7 install process asked whether phishing
                    should be turned on. After I explained it, she told me that she was about to
                    present a talk on internet security."</p>

                    <h4>Neil's Story:</h4>
                    <p>Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an incident
                        with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.</p>
                    <p class="story">"I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift, library staff are
                        the default computer technicians/troubleshooters. One night, this part-time
                        lecturer came to the counter, stating that she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc
                        stuck in the drive. She also said she felt a bit foolish, because she was
                        instructing a class in basic computing and was unable to solve the problem in
                        front of a room full of students.</p>

                    <p class="story">So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed the drive eject button, out
                        popped the tray and... no disc to be seen.</p>

                    <p class="story">Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped up,
                        'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing to an old 5.25in
                        floppy disc slot, which was there even though the drives themselves had long
                        since been decommissioned.</p>

                    <p class="story">Someone from IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine
                        and it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD back,
                        she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe it, I've done it again!'</p>

                    <p class="story">And this was their computing tutor? So there I am in front of her class,
                        shaking the heck out of the machine. So much for teaching people to handle
                        their computers with care!"</p>

                    <p>Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
                        acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
                        become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
                        people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.</p>
                    <p class="story">"Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
                        to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.</p>


                    <p class="story">I said I could and asked what they needed."</p>


                    <p class="story">The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
                    was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.</p>


                    <p class="story">"I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'</p>


                    <p class="story">She hadn't, of course."</p>

                    <h4>Chris's Story</h4>
                    <p>Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
                        proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
                        working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
                        was a local police officer.</p>

                    <p class="story">"He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
                        tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
                        his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.
                    </p>


                    <p class="story">Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
                        took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
                        gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too."
                    </p>


                    <p>It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early! This is the first we've heard of someone trying
                        to fix a computer by intimidating it.</p>
